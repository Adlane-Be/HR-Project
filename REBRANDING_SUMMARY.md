# Calima HR Rebranding Summary

## ‚úÖ Completed Changes

### 1. Application Metadata & Configuration
- **package.json**: App name changed from "foloup-app" to "calima-hr-app"
- **src/app/(client)/layout.tsx**: 
  - Page title updated to "Calima HR"
  - Description updated to "AI-powered HR Interviews"
  - Site name updated to "Calima HR"
  - Logo reference updated to "/calima-hr-logo.png"
- **docker-compose.yml**: Service name changed from "foloup" to "calima-hr"

### 2. Legal & Documentation
- **LICENSE**: Copyright updated to "Calima HR"
- **CONTRIBUTING.md**: All project references updated to Calima-HR GitHub repository
- **README.md**: Comprehensive rebranding including:
  - Main title and description
  - GitHub badges and links
  - Clone instructions
  - All project references throughout the document

### 3. User Interface
- **Navbar**: Already branded as "Calima HR" ‚úÖ (was already updated)
- **LoaderWithLogo component**: Fixed image path reference

### 4. Logo Files
- **Created**: `/public/calima-hr-logo.png` (placeholder copy of existing logo)
- **Original**: `/public/foloup.png` (kept for reference)

## üéØ Next Steps Required

### 1. Replace Logo Files
You need to replace the placeholder logo with your actual Calima HR branding:

```bash
# Replace the main logo (used in metadata and social sharing)
# Replace: /public/calima-hr-logo.png

# Optional: Replace other brand assets
# /public/Loading-Time.png (used in loading screens)
# /public/browser-client-icon.ico (browser favicon)
# /public/browser-user-icon.ico (user favicon)
```

### 2. Update Social Media Links
Consider updating the Twitter follow link in README.md if you have a Calima HR social media account.

### 3. Update Environment Variables
If you have any environment variables or external service configurations that reference the old branding, update them accordingly.

### 4. Database Considerations
The database schema includes a `logo_url` field for organizations. Existing organizations may have their own logos, which is good for multi-tenancy.

## üè¢ Multi-Tenancy Preparation

The codebase is already partially prepared for multi-tenancy:

### Already Implemented:
- **Clerk Organizations**: The app uses Clerk's organization feature
- **Organization Context**: Components use organization-specific data
- **Database Schema**: Tables include organization-specific fields
- **Logo Support**: Organizations can have custom logos via `logo_url` field

### For Full Multi-Tenancy (Next Phase):
1. **Subdomain/Domain Routing**: Route organizations to their own subdomains
2. **Custom Branding per Tenant**: Allow each organization to upload their own logos and colors
3. **Tenant Isolation**: Ensure complete data separation between organizations
4. **Billing per Tenant**: Implement organization-specific billing
5. **Custom Domains**: Allow organizations to use their own custom domains

## üìã Verification Checklist

- [ ] Replace `/public/calima-hr-logo.png` with your actual logo
- [ ] Test the application to ensure all branding appears correctly
- [ ] Update any remaining external references (domain names, API configurations, etc.)
- [ ] Review all UI components for any missed branding elements
- [ ] Update social media accounts and external documentation

## üöÄ Ready for Multi-Tenancy Planning

Once the rebranding is complete, we can proceed with implementing full multi-tenancy features. The current architecture with Clerk organizations provides a solid foundation for this next phase.
